# artventure

Various tools to explore data files from Artventure games (90s german adventure games for Amiga/PC).

- **image_fix.py** is a script for fixing image headers that have been voluntarily modified by devs to prevent users from viewing content
- **extract_from_xpkf.py** is a script for extracting images stored in XPKF/NUKE-compressed files

Currently support extracting images from :

- Holiday Maker (Amiga)
- Die Stadt der Loewen (Amiga)

Python 3 is required to run scripts.
